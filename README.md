# resty-API

4 phase React application
Phase 1: Basic Scaffolding
Phase 2: Adding State

## Lab Requirements

Phase 1: Set-up

- Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

Phase 2: useState() Hook

- In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components  

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.  

- As a user, I want to enter the REST Method and URL to an API  
- As a user, I want to see a summary of my request as well as results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format
